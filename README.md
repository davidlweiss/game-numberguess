# numberguess

A project created as part of Code Academy's Python course. This program rolls a pair of dice and asks the user to guess the sum. If the user's guess is equal to the total value of the dice roll, the user wins...otherwise, the computer wins. 

This program: 

* Prompts a user for input as to how many sides (1-6) on each dice they'd like to play with. 
* Computes the maximum value possible based on the number of sides chosen. 
* Prompts a user to guess the sum of the 2 dice "rolled"; if user makes a guess higher than the maximum value, the prompt persists.
* "Rolls" 2 dice by randomly selecting a number between 1 and the number of sides chosen using the randint function. 
* Outputs a congratulatory statement if the user's guess matches the actual sum of the dice, and a cheeky, "no dice" statement if the guess does not match.
